# WebGL_PingPong

## Introduction

Welcome to the WebGL_PingPong project! This is a simple yet exciting ping pong game developed using WebGL and JavaScript. The project is currently under development as the final project for a Computer Graphics course.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to recreate the classic game of Ping Pong using modern web technologies. We aim to leverage the power of WebGL for rendering 2D graphics and JavaScript for implementing game logic.

## Current Status

As of now, the project is in its development phase. We are actively working on implementing the core features of the game. This includes the game physics, player controls, and scoring system.

## Technologies Used

- **WebGL**: Used for rendering the game graphics on a web page. WebGL allows us to create high-performance 2D graphics right in your web browser.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the game logic. JavaScript allows us to create an interactive gaming experience.
