# WebGL_PingPong

## Introduction

Welcome to the WebGL_PingPong project! This is a fun and exciting ping pong game developed using WebGL and JavaScript. The project has been completed and is ready to be evaluated as the final project for a Computer Graphics course.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to recreate the classic game of Ping Pong using modern web technologies. I leveraged the power of WebGL for rendering 3D graphics and JavaScript for implementing game logic. The game has been successfully developed and is now complete.

## Current Status

The project has reached its completion phase. All the core features of the game, including the game physics, player controls, and scoring system, have been implemented and tested.

## Technologies Used

- **WebGL**: Used for rendering the game graphics on a web page. WebGL allowed us to create high-performance 2D graphics right in your web browser.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the game logic. JavaScript allowed us to create an interactive gaming experience.

## How to Play

To play the game, you can either git clone this repo or download the zip and extract the files. Then, use `npm i` to install all the dependencies and run the game with `npm run serve`. Alternatively, you can use the VSCode LiveServer extension by opening the HTML file with Live Server (however, this method is untested and it's recommended to use Node). Once the game is running, go to the port of the server which by default for Node is `localhost:3000`.

### Game Instructions

Welcome to Ping Pong!

- **Red card**: Press up and down arrows to move up and down
- **Blue card**: Press W and S keys to move up and down
- Press start to play!

The game's speed will increase to test your skill as time advances. Look at the scoreboard at the top to see the tracked scores. Have fun!
